# 🌐 Sofia Bargues - Web Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website as a web developer. It showcases my projects, skills, and a brief introduction about myself. The site was built using technologies like React and Tailwind CSS.

I also used AI-powered design tools like **Lovable** and **V0** (both in their free versions) to help build the layout and UI components. I really enjoyed working with **V0** – it's amazing! 😘👌
